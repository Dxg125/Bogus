  You should be generating the session ID & then storing it in a database & attaching it to a user ID. That way you know the user by looking for their session ID when they move around the website/software.
  You can record things like their IP address, browser information, and time of access to make it a tad bit more secure - making it harder for a hacker to hijack their session information.
  Also, the only other thing I should mention is that you should not be storing private information in the session data. For example, do not store their account ID in the session variables or their password/email/username/etc. It is possible to modify session data & access other accounts if you rely on the session data itself to tell you who a user is. The encrypted/randomized session IDs can be so unique that it is near impossible for a user to reasonably trick your server into thinking they are a different account. So that's why we store them in the database w/ additional information instead of setting other session variables.
  Example:
  In PHP we could have the session_id(), but store things like $_SESSION['setting'], or $_SESSION['theme_choice'] and other trivial settings to prevent having to look it up in the database every page load.
